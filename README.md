## Build Setup

```bash
# install yarn and vercel
npm i -g yarn vercel@latest

# install dependencies
$ yarn

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ yarn run dev

# serve with hot reload and serverless functions at localhost:3000
$ vercel dev -A vercel.dev.json

Note: requires `yarn run dev` be added as development command override in vercel project

# build for production and launch server
$ yarn run build
$ yarn run start

# generate static project
$ yarn run generate
```
