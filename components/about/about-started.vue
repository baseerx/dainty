            Your first step with getting started is going to our plans page and selecting a plan
            that has the features you need for your business, keeping in mind that each plan has the
            features of the plan before it. You don’t need to have your end goal in mind or know
            exactly how you want things to be because we allow you to change plans based on your
            requirements.
