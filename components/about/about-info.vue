        <div class="about-list_description text-justify">
          The beauty of a continuous subscription is its predictability - no unpleasant surprises.
          We won’t charge you extra because of unexpected issues or if you need to adjust your
          requirements halfway through a project! One change or five, it's all covered under the
          same cost! <br />Subscription service also means you can reach out with your hosting needs
          at any time, and we're prepared and eager to assist. Got a server issue at 2 am that needs
          immediate attention? No need to wait until tomorrow and schedule tedious meetings. We
          understand that time is of the essence. Just connect with us when the need arises, and
          we'll jump right into action. Welcome to the world of hassle-free hosting, my friend.

          20-ish and growing <br /><br /><strong>Where are you based?</strong> We started in
          Australia and now we’re here. Where’s here? It’s everywhere. We love to roam the world
          like good little Millennials. <br /><br /><strong>What are your trading hours?</strong> We
          like to keep it fresh and flexible Monday to Friday in AEST. Our standard is to respond to
          our beautiful clients within 1 business day. <br /><br /><strong

          >
          We’re currently using Intercom which is a much better option to emails. However, we’re
          also building a client portal so we won’t need Intercom OR emails in the near future.
