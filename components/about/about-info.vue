          Dainty thinks about design and web design mockups a little differently. We don’t think you
          should have to chase a gaggle of different freelancers or pay a truckload of money for
          sexy designs. So we’ve wedged ourselves somewhere in the middle. Into the sweet spot!
          <br />
          <br />
          Our subscription model means you can use our team of designers for one low, fixed monthly
          payment. Plain and simple. That’s us.
          <br />
          And if you’ve got ideas you want to fruition, we can’t wait to meet you.

          We know what we do best. We keep our subscription prices low by making sure our team can
          deliver the the most bang for your buck. How do we do it? We have specially crafted our
          <a href="/donts">do's and don’ts list</a>, and built a team to match, ensuring we can
          offer the most essential services you’d need for your project or business. Websites
          mockups, web and print designs, that’s our jam. Wanna see? Mmmm…

        <div class="about-list_description">
          The greatest thing about an ongoing subscription is that there are no nasty surprises. We
          won’t charge you extra because things got delayed or you changed your mind halfway through
          a task! One revision or five, it all comes at the same cost!
          <br />
          <br />
          Subscription service means you can also pop in with design needs at any time, and we’re
          ready and waiting. Got an idea at 2 am that you need to get going now? No need to call
          someone tomorrow and organize meetings (ewww). Ain’t nobody got time for that. Hop on and
          let us know when the inspiration strikes and we’ll get busy cooking. Welcome to the good
          life, my friend.

          20-ish and growing <br /><br /><strong>Where are you based?</strong> We started in
          Australia and now we’re here. Where’s here? It’s everywhere. We love to roam the world
          like good little Millennials. <br /><br /><strong>What are your trading hours?</strong> We
          like to keep it fresh and flexible Monday to Friday in AEST. Our standard is to respond to
          our beautiful clients within 1 business day. <br /><br /><strong
            >How do you communicate with clients?</strong
          >
          We’re currently using Intercom which is a much better option to emails. However, we’re
          also building a client portal so we won’t need Intercom OR emails in the near future.
