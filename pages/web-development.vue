                With the team at Dainty, we have world class designers and developers that will work
                hand in hand with the scrum master to develop the most marketable and user friendly
                website. Sometimes the best is stepping away professionally and looking in the
                perspective of a user. Extensive revision will be utilised to make sure we have a
                product that has perfect persona & branding definition, user experience flow and
                site-mapping.

                The user interface mantra we go off by is ‚Äúa UI is like a joke, if you have to
                explain it, it's not good‚Äù. Beautifully designed, simple solutions that make sense.

                We understand that for this process to go smoothly, communication is paramount.
                Throughout the journey of development, we will test, demo, get your thoughts, build,
                test and repeat. We want you to be as involved as much as our development team is to
                ensure the product you paid for exceeds your expectations. We work with all major
                open source CMS, eCom platforms and web application framework. You choose, we do.
